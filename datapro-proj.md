Introducing - the Fake Name Maker!
========================================================
type: changebgcolour
Scenario One

You have a young child, and they come to you one day asking,
"What could my fake name be?"
You could be the cool parent that has a ready answer with this 
Fake Name Maker.

Scenario Two

You are in a bar, a male/female catches your eye.
You want to start a conversation, but you have a sudden desire to use another name.
Enter the Fake Name Maker.

Fake Name Maker
========================================================
By entering information into two text boxes, and selecting your birth month, you can quickly get your own unique Fake Name.

Impress your friends, your kids, alleviate bordom, or just because, use the Fake Name Maker! 

Your day will perhaps become just a little bit brighter after obtaining a Fake Name for the day.  Enjoy!



Slide With Code
========================================================


```r
anarray <- c("Tony Bone","John Haddock","Donna Russell","Sue Miller")
for(i in 1:length(anarray) ) {
  print(anarray[i])  
}
```

```
[1] "Tony Bone"
[1] "John Haddock"
[1] "Donna Russell"
[1] "Sue Miller"
```


These people, were either bored, or annoying me, or completely made up, and so were coerced into using my Fake Name Maker, and bribed into saying they liked it, and I have to return some r code within the slide presentation. Yes, I know it's basic, but there is not a lot to output.


Acknowledgements
======================================================== 
Thanks to my son, Tony Bone, (who is off school due to growing too damn fast that the tendon in his foot isn't stretching fast enough, so that he is having difficulty walking), but who is managing to keep quiet enough for me to finish this project.

My dog, Choco, who is sitting on my feet and keeping them warm ( although he is snoring quite loudly...)

Thanks to the internet connection, which has been flaky the last few days, but seems to be steadier today.  Hope that wasn't famous last words.
