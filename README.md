# DataprodProject
Project for the Developing Data Products course

This is a simple input/output project to showcase that I can create something which takes input, does something with that input, and then outputs that calculation to the screen.
In this case, the calculation is just a paste function.  It could have been a some sort of mathematical computation, or something similar, which would have been about as easy, but would have taken longer to deal with. However, the project purpose is to deploy a shiny app to the shiny server, which I have done.

This project combines text and select input and then outputs a silly new name for entertainment, on click of the "Name Me" button
